# Villager interaction mod

This Minecraft mod introduces a new behavior system for Vindicators, categorizing them into different clans. Vindicators will exhibit unique interactions based on their clan affiliations, seeking companionship with fellow clan members while becoming irritable and potentially aggressive over time.

## Features

- **Clans**: Vindicators are assigned to different clans, each represented by a unique banner and weapon type.
- **Behavior Based on Clan Affiliation**:
  - **Same Clan**: Vindicators will seek companionship with fellow clan members. Over time, they may become irritable if they stay too close, eventually attempting to move away. If their irritation level gets too high, they will start attacking each other.
  - **Different Clans**: Vindicators from different clans will always attack each other on sight.
